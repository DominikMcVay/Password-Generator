# Password-Generator

This is a password generator that prompts the user for several different criterias. First, when the "Generate Password" button is clicked, it asks for a number between 8-128 to determine the length of the password. It does not accept values outside of this range. Given a valid value, it will then prompt the user multiple times to ask if lowercase, uppercase, numerical, and special characters should be included. The user may answer with either "y" or "yes" for yes, or "n" or "no" for no. They are not case sensitive. If the user inputs "n" or "no" for every prompt, then the password generation will fail and they will be asked to try again. The program will then randomly generate a password within the confines provided by the user and display it on the screen. If the user wants to generate a new password, the old one will be cleared to make room for the newer one.
